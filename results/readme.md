# Results

In the speaker_dependent, speaker_independent, zero_shot, and baselines directories, you can find tables with the results of the experiments conducted for my thesis. The baselines directory contains results of the ``baseline'' experiments, to examine what aspects of speech impact wav2vec2's performance, including speech rate and pitch. In the remaining three directories, you can find results of experiments that finetuned wav2vec2 models and evaluated their performance on test sets consisting of (1) data held-out from the same speakers in the training set (speaker-dependent), (2) data from unseen speakers (speaker-independent), and (3) unseen dysarthric speech data (zero-shot). The archive directory contains the raw output files from the evaluation and training scripts and includes experiments that were not discussed in my thesis (due to space constraints or issues with the experimental set up).
