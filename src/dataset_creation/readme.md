# Dataset creation scripts

These scripts are used to create, filter, and preprocess the datasets used for this study. It's included under the `src` because of shared dependencies with the `dataset_utils` module.

To run all the scripts, use the bash script file `scripts/make_all_data_splits.sh` or use the command `python -m dataset_creation` with optional arguments `--new_averages`, `--noise_reduce_torgo`, and `--new_metadata`.
